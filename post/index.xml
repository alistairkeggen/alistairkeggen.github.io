      <description>Hello! Hola! Bonjour! Privet!
I, for one, love to listen to other languages. Especially through music! Listening to international songs featuring a plethora of languages is the perfect way to safely experience the world during a global pandemic. Can I mention that its budget friendly as well?
Pack your imaginary bags and prep your ears for takeoff, we are going on a sonic world tour. Featuring artists from countries such as Brazil, Switzerland, Japan, and Russia, this playlist features some of my favorite foreign language artists and songs.</description>
